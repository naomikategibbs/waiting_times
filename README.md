# waiting_times
This is the R code for a decision analytic model to estimate the health impact of waiting for elective surgery in England.
This version of the model is deterministic. It draws in a number of parameter inputs estimated using routine datasets such 
as Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Office for National Statistics mortality figures, Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and 
Private Health Information Network. It also draws on data from the academic literature.

Only the model is provided, and the data is not shared as some of the model inputs are estimated from confidential, protected data, namely the HES and PROMs data.

The model is primarily a Markov model. 

The full methodological approach and all the data inputs are outlined in the following paper: "include link to published paper."
